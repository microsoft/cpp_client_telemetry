This tutorial guides you through the process of downloading and configuring Fiddler inspector on Windows in order to see events sent with 1DS C++ Client SDK.

### **Installation instructions for 1DS Events protocol decoder / inspector for Fiddler**

1. Install latest Fiddler. Activate HTTPS traffic decoding. Follow the installer instructions on how to do this.

2. Copy the Fiddler inspector binary with latest CS3.0 protocol (with some CS4.0 fields) and bond protocol support located here:

    **\\\\ARIA-BUILD-01.REDMOND.CORP.MICROSOFT.COM\\Releases\\Windows\\tools\\Fiddler\\OneDSInspector.zip**

3. Go to _**%AppData%\Local\Programs\Fiddler\Inspectors**_ and delete the v1 inspector if you have it. The v1 inspector uses an older version of the Bond lib and it will crash if you keep both versions in one directory. Deploy the contents of the copied .zip file (step 2) to that same directory.

### **Running Fiddler and reading events**

1. Launch Fiddler on Windows

2. Go to Fiddler's proxy settings on: Tools > Options > HTTPS and make sure both options are checked: _**Capture HTTPS CONNECTs**_ and _**Decrypt HTTPS traffic**_

3. Make sure you click the [OK] button when enabling decryption.

That would redirect all the HTTPS traffic via Fiddler

Now the events should be decrypted and formated to JSON when clicked on Fiddler.
