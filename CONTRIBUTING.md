## How to build the SDK

Platform specific build instructions:
- [Windows](docs/cpp-start-windows.md)
- [Windows/clang](build-cmake-clang.cmd)
- [Mac](docs/cpp-start-macosx.md)
- [Linux](docs/cpp-start-linux.md). [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) can be used to build for various Linux distros. Please refer to [build-docker.cmd](build-docker.cmd) script and [the list of supported containers](docker/). Docker build script accepts the container name as first argument.
- [iOS/iPadOS](build-ios.sh)
- [Android](docs/cpp-start-android.md)

Other resources to learn how to setup the build system:
- Review how our cross-platform build system is implemented using [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows) infrastructure
- Check the build scripts located in workspace root

## Issues and Feature Requests

Issues and feature requests are tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/cpp_client_telemetry/issues).

## Pull Request

### How to Send Pull Requests

Everyone is welcome to contribute code to `1DS C++ SDK` via GitHub pull requests (PRs).

Please do not fork. Our CI is setup to accept PRs only from the main *microsoft/cpp_client_telemetry* repo.

To create a new PR, clone the repo:

```sh
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/cpp_client_telemetry.git
```

Check out a new branch, make modifications and push the branch:

```sh
$ git checkout -b ${USERNAME}/feature_branch_name
# edit files
$ git commit -m "Description"
$ git push ${USERNAME}/feature_branch_name
```

Then open a PR against the main `microsoft/cpp_client_telemetry` repo.

### How to Receive Comments

* If the PR is not ready for review, please put `[WIP]` in the title, tag it
  as `work-in-progress`, or mark it as [`draft`](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
* Make sure CLA is signed and CI is clear.

### Making Changes to Modules
* Navigate to lib/modules
* Check out a branch of [the modules repository.](https://github.com/microsoft/cpp_client_telemetry_modules/)
* Create a PR from your branch to cpp_client_telemetry's master branch.

### How to Get PR Merged

A PR is considered to be **ready to merge** when:
* It has received at least one approval from Maintainers.
* Major feedbacks are resolved.
* It has been open for review for at least one working day. This gives people reasonable time to review.
* Trivial change (typo, cosmetic, doc, etc.) doesn't have to wait for one day.
* Urgent fix can take exception as long as it has been actively communicated.
* Any dependent submodule changes have updated the submodule commit id (`git add lib/modules`)
* Any Collaborator/Maintainer can merge the PR once it is **ready to merge**.
* In exceptional scenarios (build break, privacy issue, GitHub actions failure, CI failure), when other Approvers are unavailable - Administrators may exercise their right to Merge notifying the other Approvers in a comment to PR.

Do not push directly to the *master*.

## Style Guidelines

[Coding style guidelines](docs/Coding%20style.md)

_Please note that we are rapidly evolving product with many different contributors.
Some modules have been written following platform-specific coding style.
Please try to keep your changes consistent with the coding style of a module you are modifying._

There is a *.clang-format* file included in the repo. Please use your favourite IDE with Clang Format tooling installed.
